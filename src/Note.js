            <p>So it's your birthday all again and you haven't grown even a centimeter :p </p>
            <p>Well favdi i must say its been quite years now since we are friends i still remember days
             you were used to ignore me :p. In this journey we became friends then maybe bestfriends and now
             strangers? nah,<b> Once Bestfriends always Bestfriends</b>. you might be thinking that I'm the strangest
             person you have ever met, sometimes overly expressive,  sometimes not at all expressive, yeah you can call 
             me wierd </p>
            <p>So for today I'm gonna put my heart out, Trust me i always want to talk to you, yet i dont. 
            sometimes i want to hangout with you, yet you don't, that's fine you have more good people to be consider into the
             category of Bestfriends. Maybe we were never Bestfriends and we were just pretending to be Bestfriends maybe i don't hold 
            that importance in your life. But now it dosn't ever bothers me </p>
        </div>
        <div className="notebook">
            <p>Really i dont want, you to ever leave Mumbai. Maybe I'm wierd, maybe i dont want to fall 
            in the trap of Love again but i still care for you. I don't understand people beacuse in reality i dont understand myself
            </p>
            <p>I wish someday we will talk about this all but yet i don't want that day to come. i'm totally wierd 
            i know that thanks to bare with me all the way along. Evern though i acted like a shitty crap with you, you 
            handled it in calm way maybe we are Bestfriends and i'm assuming all the crap. </p>
            <p>Anyway Sorry for bringing all the mess in your birthday card, I'm glad to have you, enjoy your 22nd birthday have a great life ahead sweetheart</p>
            <p>P.S. I'm quite lazy so i have made this page quite cheaply and even i'm feeling quite sleepy right now</p>
